# login-testing-project - Manual QA Practice
This project focuses on manual testing of a sample login website that displays credentials for the user to authenticate. The goal was to gain hands-on QA experience by designing systematic test cases, identifying defects, and performing regression testing.

## Files
| File | Purpose |
| **test_cases.xlsx** | All test cases with expected vs actual results and pass/fail status |
| **bug_reports.pdf** | Detailed bug reports with reproduction steps and severity |
| **regression_results.txt** | Regression run results to verify consistent behavior |

## What Was Tested
- Valid and invalid login attempts  
- Empty input behavior  
- Incorrect credentials  
- Whitespace handling  
- Long input strings  
- Special characters  
- Case sensitivity  

## Skills Gained
- Manual QA testing
- Test case design & execution
- Bug reporting & documentation
- Regression testing process
- Using GitHub for version control
